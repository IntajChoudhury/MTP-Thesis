[DONE] 1. With and without constraints accuracy violations and all into a table for small epochs (limited laptop) and for large show comparable, also show training curve in both cases,
          show diff experiments of 5 epochs, 10 epochs, .... few short learnings
[DONE] 2. add some more noise, whether in noisy case is it recognising?
[DONE] 3. show which are misclassified, tell the reason, show positive and negative cases
[DONE] 4. explain how it's creating new constraint?
[DONE] 5. find some niche cases and some more analysis for better grades





TO DO (for each dataset)
-----

0. Go through the paper thoroughly
1. Add tables of with and without noise (like incorrect class labels or distorted image pixels), and show superior with constraints for long epochs too, show some graphs and all
2. Make graph of everything like loss, training curve of accuracy in both cases with & without constraints, accuracy violations, 
3. Tables for accuracy at different epochs with & without constraints, violations, (at higher epochs show same comparable accuracy), 5, 10, ... epochs, few short learnings.
4. Diagrams of simple ANN for each dataset, misclassified diagrams tell the reason, show +ve -ve cases in diagrams
5. Some diagrams of weights, how new constraints are getting created, look in the paper as well
6. find some niche cases and some more analysis for better grades, search in gpt


[DONE] Accuracy - tables + training curve graph
[DONE] Loss - graphs + tables
[DONE] Violations - diagrams of misclassified +ve -ve e.g
[DONE] Diagrams - Equations + Dataset views / classes / pre-constraints / new-constraints + Models & it's code





For Thesis
----------

1. Add liter review
2. table of pros and cons
3. why it's required, motivation
